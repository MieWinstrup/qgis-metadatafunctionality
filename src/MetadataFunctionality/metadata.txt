about=
    With Metadata-DB-linker you can use QGIS to enter metadata to new and existing tables stored in a Postgresdatabase. If you create a table or import data to a table in a Postgresdatabase with DB Manager, the Metadata-DB-link is automatically launched
    The metadata which can be entered is:
     - Descriptive name
     - Description of content
     - Kle journalnumber (automatically assigned if you have access to Taxon-taxonomy)
     - Responsible centre or employ√©e
     - Projects in which the file is used
     - Last changes to metadatainformation (automatically assigned)
    The table in which metadata is stored needs to follow a specific datastructure. The sql-definition of the table is found in the Settings-dialog.
